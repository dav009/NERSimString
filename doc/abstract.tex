\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present three different approaches based on Approximate Dictionary Matching Algorithm that uses similarity measures for the retrieval of Named Entities. For the evaluation, we extracted PERSON Named Entity types from the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task Corpus Data. In order to determine the fastest search approach, for the results, we compare CoNLL data the average processing times outputted by these different dictionary implementations.\\\textbf{keywords}: Information Extraction, dictionary search, similarity measures, simString, Named Entities, NEs, NER.
