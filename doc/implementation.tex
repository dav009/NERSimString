The memory mapped hashtable comes with a memory cost, that is since the speed of  a hashtable is to be kept but it will be stored in different files, then a lot of markers and a fix offset of bytes has to be used in order to assure what is in each slot, this means extra memory will be necessary when compared ot the other dictionaries implementations.

To developers NerSimString was implemented in such way so that adding a new dictionary implementation is ndependant of the simString algorithm, in such way new experiments and datastructures can be added.
