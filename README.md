NERSimString
============

NERSimString is a Java reimplementation of the SimString algorithm
proposed by Naoaki Okazaki ( http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring ).

This re-implementation is oriented to the task of Name entity annotation,
and it is implemented in such a way that adding extra structures for Name entity signatures
should be rather straight forward.
