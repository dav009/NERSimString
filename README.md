NERSimString
============

NERSimString is a Java reimplementation of the SimString algorithm
proposed by Naoaki Okazaki ( http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring ).<br>
<br>

SimString is an algorithm for approximate Search (Fuzzy Search). 
In this project we  present 3 different approaches based on Approximate Dictionary Matching Algorithm that uses similarity measures for the
retrieval of Named Entities. <br>
<br>

This re-implementation is oriented to the task of Name entity annotation,
and it is implemented in such a way that adding extra structures for Name entity signatures
should be rather straight forward.<br>
<br>
